PROGRAMMERS SAMPLE POEM:
Please rate my poem 1 - 10 

In every lines of code, our dreams reside 
Through loops and functions, we create 
With every push, a step we take 
With open source, we rise and share 

So here we stand, as coders true 
Crafting wonders, we create
Solutions born, beyond debate
To build, to learn, to innovate
